# hello-agent MVP Plan

## 1. Purpose & Context
- **Objective:** Deliver a documented handshake between `codex-agent` HQ and the downstream `hello-agent` repo that outlines scope, milestones, and owners for the MVP integration.
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Plan approved by Product, Finance, and HR reviewers.
  - Integration checklist in `docs/INTEGRATION_HELLO_AGENT.md` reflects the drafted plan.
  - Audit log captures kickoff plus approvals for traceability.

## 2. Scope
### In-Scope Deliverables
1. Documented workflow for syncing plans between repos.
2. Definition of reporting cadence (weekly product review, monthly finance snapshot).
3. HR inclusion guidelines for performance tracking and staffing.

### Out-of-Scope (MVP)
- Automated deployment or bot-driven synchronization.
- Budget approvals beyond the MVP monitoring window.
- Security automation changes outside manual checklist alignment.

## 3. Milestones & Timeline
| Milestone | Owner | Target Date | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MVP plan drafted & filed (`projects/hello-agent/docs/MVP_PLAN.md`) | Engineer Agent | 2025-10-25 | Current document |
| Product review + feedback incorporated | Product Agent | 2025-10-27 | Required for `pipeline.yaml` product_review gate |
| Finance review & budget note | Finance Agent | 2025-10-28 | Confirms no incremental spend beyond monitoring |
| HR tracking update | HR Agent | 2025-10-28 | Ensures performance metrics capture cross-team effort |
| Integration checklist closure | Engineer Agent | 2025-10-29 | Flip outstanding checklist items once validations done |

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities
- **Engineer Agent:** Own documentation updates, integration tests, and audit entries.
- **Product Agent:** Validate scope, provide roadmap alignment, sign off on product_review gate.
- **Finance Agent:** Confirm financial coverage and update `finance/` summaries if needed.
- **HR Agent:** Track contributors, staff planning, and ensure retrospectives capture learnings.
- **Compliance Agent (support):** Review audit entries and release checklist mapping.

## 5. Dependencies & Inputs
- `.codex/plan.yaml` — defines orchestration steps (`hello_agent_mvp_plan`).
- `pipeline.yaml` — specifies gates (product_review, finance_review) applicable to this effort.
- `docs/deployments/HELLO_AGENT_MVP_DPD.md` — deployment guardrails and rollback strategy.
- `audit/logs/2025-10-25.md` — authoritative record for approvals.

## 6. Implementation Workstreams
| Workstream | Description | Tasks | Owner | Status / Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A. MVP Plan Drafting | Maintain and iterate on `hello-agent/docs/MVP_PLAN.md` with stakeholder feedback. | Track comments, capture decisions, keep milestones updated. | Engineer Agent | In progress — v1 drafted 2025-10-25; future edits gated by weekly product reviews. |
| B. Doc Sync Validation | Ensure bidirectional sync between `codex-agent` HQ and the hello-agent repo. | Follow `projects/hello-agent/docs/DOC_SYNC_CHECKLIST.md`, log evidence in audit file. | Engineer Agent | Checklist operational with helper script `projects/hello-agent/scripts/doc_sync_diff.sh`; last run logged 2025-10-25 10:30 UTC. |
| C. Reporting Alignment | Map MVP metrics to finance + release reporting templates. | Update `reports/` summaries, confirm gates in `pipeline.yaml`. | Product & Finance Agents | Baseline mapping completed 2025-10-25; see `reports/README.md` “hello-agent MVP Reporting Alignment”. |
| D. HR & Compliance Tracking | Keep staffing/performance notes and compliance hooks current. | Update HR prompt/logs, align with `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`. | HR & Compliance Agents | Addendum for hello-agent MVP appended to `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`; tracking call-outs logged 2025-10-25. |

## 7. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Review delays block release readiness | Medium | Pre-schedule reviewer slots; capture async approvals in audit log |
| Scope creep beyond MVP | Medium | Keep out-of-scope list visible; escalate via Product Agent |
| Missing compliance trail | High | Update audit log immediately after key actions |

## 8. Validation & Exit Criteria
- Integration checklist items marked complete once plan + validation steps are performed.
- Product/Finance/HR approvals documented in audit log.
- Any follow-up tasks captured in `projects/hello-agent/tasks/` for post-MVP iterations.

## 9. Review & Sign-off
| Role | Reviewer | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product | Product Agent | Approved | audit/logs/2025-10-25.md |
| Finance | Finance Agent | Approved | audit/logs/2025-10-25.md |
| HR | HR Agent | Approved | audit/logs/2025-10-25.md |
